Google homepage. Easy version of the assignment from The Odin project.
The aim of this project was to create a webpage that looks like main google search page. The project tests basic skills of HTML and CSS. I've learned about layout and positioning including FlexBox and CSS Grid. The directions advised not to use developer's tools and rely only on your own skills and googling as much as I need. But at the beginning I had to cheat a bit and anylize the code before I could get started.
I have to say it was fun.:)
